            a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
            [7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. 
            It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
            and first-class functions.
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies 
            of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and 
            is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites 
            use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers 
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
            As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, 
            functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application 
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular 
            expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model 
            (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output 
            (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host 
            environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
            Originally used only in web browsers, JavaScript engines are 
            also now embedded in server-side website deployments 
            and non-browser applications.
            Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, 
            including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, 
            the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
